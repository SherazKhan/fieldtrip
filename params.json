{"name":"FieldTrip","tagline":"the Matlab toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis","body":"FieldTrip is the MATLAB software toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis that is being developed by a team of researchers at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in close collaboration with collaborating institutes.\r\n\r\nThe FieldTrip toolbox includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis of MEG and EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the data formats of all major MEG systems (CTF, Neuromag, 4D/BTi, Yokogawa) and of the most popular EEG systems, and new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis protocols in Matlab. Furthermore, it easily allows developers to incorporate low-level algorithms for new EEG/MEG analysis methods.\r\n\r\nThe FieldTrip homepage can be found at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org, which is where all documentation can be found.\r\n\r\nThe FieldTrip  email discussion list can be found at http://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip\r\n\r\nThe GIT repository is available from https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip. Alternatively, a read-only version of the SVN repository is available from http://fieldtrip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk. Both external SVN and GIT versions are synchronized frequently with the in-house development version. To use one of these development versions version, you will need to use an SVN or GIT client.\r\n\r\nYou can use the read-only copy to [keep up to date](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commits/master) with the latest changes to the source code, to revert to older versions, and to track all individual changes to the files. If you need to stay even more up to date, you can request access to the in-house SVN version.\r\n\r\nThe GIT and SVN versions are meant for technically inclined users that want to track the development in detail, the [ftp download](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download) version will be most appropriate for most regular users.\r\n\r\nBugs and feature requests can be reported at http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org","google":"UA-5858718-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
